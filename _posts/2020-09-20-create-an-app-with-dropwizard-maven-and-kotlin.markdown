In this post, I am going to show you how to create a simple and basic Dropwizard app. This is going to be a technical tutorial.

At the end of this tutorial, your app will expose a RESTful API.
The code is written in Kotlin, but you can do the same with Java.

I will start with a short explanation about Dropwizard and Maven.

# Dropwizard 
Dropwizard is a light Java framework for building RESTful web services. Dropwizard collects together stable libraries, such as Jersey, Jackson, and JDBI, into a lightweight package.

# Maven
Maven is a build automation and management tool for Java.
With Maven, it is easy to define the building of the software and the dependencies.
POM is an XML file that describes a Maven project and its dependencies.

Maven in Yiddish is "person with understanding, expert". This is the origin of the name for this tool.




# Creating a new project
I will use IntelliJ Community Edition IDE in this tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
Click on File --> New --> Project --> Maven  
You are going to see the following screen:

Click on "Next". Now you are ready to define the POM file.

# Defining the POM file
As I described at the beginning of the tutorial, we have to define the dependencies of the project in the POM.xml file. Let's do it together.

## Properties
In the properties tag, define the version of Dropwizard and Kotlin you want to use.
You can also define Kotlin compiler configurations through properties. In this case, I defined languageVersion (you want to ensure source compatibility with the specified version of Kotlin) and jvmTarget (the target version of the generated JVM bytecode).
```xml
<properties>
	<dropwizard.version>2.0.13</dropwizard.version>
	<kotlin.version>1.4.10</kotlin.version>
	<kotlin.compiler.languageVersion>1.4</kotlin.compiler.languageVersion>
	<kotlin.compiler.jvmTarget>1.8</kotlin.compiler.jvmTarget>
</properties>
```

### Dependencies
Your project needs dependencies in order to compile, build, run and test.
In the dependencies tag, we will define dropwizard-core and kotlin-stdlib-jdk8

```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>io.dropwizard</groupId>
		<artifactId>dropwizard-core</artifactId>
		<version>${dropwizard.version}</version>
	</dependency>

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
		<artifactId>kotlin-stdlib-jdk8</artifactId>
		<version>${kotlin.version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
